           $player = Audio::Play::MPlayer->new;

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       This module acts as a frontend to an external MPlayer process started
       with the "-slave" command-line option.  The idea and interface (and in
       part the code) has been taken from Audio::Play::MPG123.

       Please see Audio::Play::MPG123 for the documentation.  Take into
       account that the methods:

           copyrighted
           emphasis
           error_protected
           extension
           layer
           mode
           mode_extension
           stat
           statfreq
           type
           url
           IN

       have not been implemented, and that:

           jump
           tpf

       work differently: "jump" takes offsets in seconds, and "tpf" always
       returns 1 to make it possible to write:

           $player->jump( 60 / $player->tpf );
